<h1 align="center">Coal Mine Safety Device</h1>

## About
This project focuses on enhancing safety measures in coal mines by developing a coal mine safety device using Arduino and various sensors. The device integrates an Arduino with an I2C module, MQ2 gas sensor, LM35 temperature sensor, and DHT sensor for distance and humidity monitoring.

## Features
* Gas Detection: The MQ2 gas sensor detects harmful gases such as methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) to prevent potential hazards.
* Temperature Monitoring: The LM32 temperature sensor monitors the ambient temperature within the coal mine to prevent overheating.
* Humidity Sensing: The DHT sensor measures humidity levels to ensure optimal working conditions and prevent moisture-related issues.
* Real-time Data: The device provides real-time data on gas concentration, temperature, humidity, and distance.
